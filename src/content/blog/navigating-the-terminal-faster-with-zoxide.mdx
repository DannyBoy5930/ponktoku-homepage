[GitHub - ajeetdsouza/zoxide: A smarter cd command. Supports all major shells.](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

I've heard of z-jumper but not zoxide. Zoxide is a smarter cd command. 

> It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes. Zoxide works on all major shells.

It's a nice and easier out of box experience than I had with z-jumper. It's built with Rust, frequently updated (at the time of writing) and available on multiple platforms.

You can use `z` as you would `cd` (Change Directory) but Zoxide has some extra quality of life features.

## Zoxide cheatsheet

```bash
# Zoxide commands
add     Add a new directory or increment its rank
edit    Edit the database
import  Import entries from another application
init    Generate shell configuration
query   Search for a directory in the database
remove  Remove a directory from the database

# Normal use to jump directories
z <path>

# Zoxide interactive mode (requires fzf)
zi

# Query a path
zoxide query <path>

# Query a path with its score
zoxide query <path> -s

# List all matching directories
zoxide query -l

# List all matching directories with score using less utility
zoxide query -l -s | less

# Remove a given directory from database
zoxide remove <path>

# Brings up interactive menu to modify entries in your database
zoxide edit
```

Extra notes:

- `zoxide remove <path>` is handy to remove any unresolved paths that are no longer around
- `zoxide edit` is useful to see and modify everything in your database at once
- `zoxide query`
	- `-l` flag lists all entries
	- `-s` flag shows the score of an entry
	- Using both shows all paths and their score in the database
- You can move up and down in `zi` with `ctrl-p/n` or use vim motions with `ctrlj/k` 
- Use the linux `| less` utility to view your database with pages as your database gets bigger

## How it works under the hood

As you move around directories using `z` or `cd` Zoxide keeps track of your most visited paths and applies a weighting system to them they call 'score'.

### Usage

Say you edit in your `~/Developer/Code/project-x` folder a lot because you're working on a new project. With Zoxide you can use `z project-x` and jump multiple folders to get to the 'project-x' folder in one command. 

### 4 things to keep in mind when searching with Zoxide

- The search term is case insensitive
- All of the terms must be contained within the path in the same order
- The last component of the last keyword must match the last component of the path
- All matches are returned in descending order of their weights

## Zoxide interactive mode with fzf (fuzzy find)

Zoxide can work together with fzf. Use the `zi` to bring up zoxide interactive mode which is a fuzzy finder for your zoxide database. It shows all your paths and their score in a menu. You can scroll up and down with `ctrl+p and ctrl+n or ctrl+j/k` for vim motions

```bash
# Zoxide interactive mode
zi
```
