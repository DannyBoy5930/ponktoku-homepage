CSS `z-index` is a property used to control the stacking order of positioned elements in the HTML document. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

```css
# CSS
img {
	z-index: -1;
}

# Tailwindcss
<img class="z-50" />
```

## My use case

In the process of building my portfolio website I stumbled upon a case where images for my Article/Post Card components were going on top of the navigation bar. I thought it might be an issue with the `relative` positioning I used in the styling of the card but that was not the case.
### Images of the problem

### The solution (using z-index)

![Fixing overlapping elements with css z-index property](../../assets/posts/css-z-index/css-z-index-3.png)

The solution was to use the z-index css property, which when put on elements determines what element goes on top. So I added a z-index of 50 with tailwind (`z-50`) onto the navigation bar and it worked, other page elements now go underneath my sticky navigation bar.

TLDR: The higher element z-index goes on top.

Example: 2 squares one has z-index of 1 and the other has z-index of 2. The z-index 2 square is the one that appears on top if there ever is any overlap on the page.
