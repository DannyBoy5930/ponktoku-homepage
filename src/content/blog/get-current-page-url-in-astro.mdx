[`Astro.url`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astrourl) returns the current page URL from the Request object. The return value is a [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) object which contains properties like pathname and origin.

```js
const currentPath = Astro.url.pathname;
```

Useful when you need to highlight navigation links based on current page:

```jsx
<a href="/me" class={currentPath === '/me' ? 'active' : ''}>
  About Me
</a>
```

## Cutting off the url pathname for nested URLs

[String.split()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) splits a given string into an array of substrings based on a specific separator and returns an array of substrings. Thus, we use the `string.split()` JavaScript method to split the string URL by the `'/'` in the URL path. 

Useful for when you have a nested path in your URL such as on a blog and your posts are nested inside a folder like `/localhost:4321/posts/...` and you want to use only part of the URL pathname to determine styling on the navigation bar. 

```js
const currentPath = Astro.url.pathname; // "/works/wordwise"
const firstPath = currentPath.split("/")[1];
console.log(firstPath); // returns 'works'

currentPath.split("/")[0]; // returns '/'
currentPath.split("/")[2]; // returns 'wordwise'
```

When square brackets with a number are added to the `split()` method, it specifies the maximum number of splits to perform. Alternatively you can also put a number inside the method brackets. E.g. `string.split('/', 2)`
